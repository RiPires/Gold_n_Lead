Several material files are available. Materials are given in "material.in" file.

The program is driven by "input_main.f"

"u232.in" file contains a spectrum of U-232 alpha source.

The program can also be run in single-energy mode.

Units are: cm, MeV

To run under linux:   ./main.sh  

Energy in detector includes energy loss in gold window
